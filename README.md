## Project Overview

The Healthcare Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive Power BI solution that provides deep insights into patient demographics, hospital admission trends, medical diagnoses, treatment costs, and insurance billing performance from 2019 to 2024. 

This dashboard enables stakeholders to explore patterns in patient profiles, evaluate hospital and insurance provider performance, and uncover regional healthcare trends. It is designed for healthcare administrators, analysts, and policy decision-makers aiming to enhance patient outcomes and operational efficiency.


## Objectives

- To analyze patient profiles including age, gender, and blood type across different years.

- To identify trends in hospital admissions by type (emergency, urgent, elective) and average length of stay.

- To examine the most diagnosed medical conditions and their distribution by age and gender.

- To understand treatment costs by condition, admission type, and insurance provider.

- To evaluate regional differences in billing amounts and test results.

- To support data-driven decision-making for improving healthcare quality and efficiency.

  
## Technology & Tools Used

- Power BI – For interactive dashboard development, data visualization, and geospatial mapping.

- Power Query & DAX – For data transformation, calculated measures, and custom KPIs.

- Excel – For initial data preparation and integration with Power BI.

  
## Key Insights :

- A total of 55.5K patients were treated, with an average hospital stay of 16 days.

- Emergency admissions account for the largest share compared to urgent and elective.

- “Abnormal” test results are the most frequently observed.

- Hypertension is the most commonly diagnosed medical condition.

- Average treatment cost is around $25.5K, consistent across most conditions.

- Age groups 30–59 show higher susceptibility to chronic illnesses like diabetes and obesity.

- Male patients make up 60% of the total patient population.

- The Southeast region has the highest billing amount at $758.49M, followed by the East and West.

- Medicare and private insurance (especially Cigna) dominate healthcare coverage and show cost and test result variances.

  
## Conclusion

The Healthcare Analysis Dashboard provides a powerful visual exploration of the healthcare landscape, highlighting key metrics across patient care, hospital operations, and financial performance. It reveals valuable patterns in how care is delivered and financed, enabling hospitals and insurers to identify areas of improvement. With its clear and actionable insights, this dashboard supports better planning, resource allocation, and patient care strategies in the healthcare industry.
